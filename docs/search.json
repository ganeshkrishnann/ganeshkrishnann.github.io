The overall goal of the website is to provide a platform that enables data experts, model experts and domain experts to make decisions, diagnose issues, and account for uncertainty at various stages. It gives a background to various steps of the automated bullet matching pipeline, starting from scans to scores and how various algorithmic results can be used to make coherent decisions under uncertainty. The website hosts two applications that is used for visual diagnostics and process approval in both pre-score settings and post-score settings, which allows inspection, validation of various different levels of the bullet matching pipeline."

The black vertical line separates between two bullets. The striation marks are visible on both the LEAs and the firearm examiners tries to align them by rotating one of the bullets till they seem to align correctly. If two LEAs are aligned correctly, the examiner visually makes a comparison and deduction on whether the two LEAs seem to match. If they conclude its a match, they quickly make synchronized in-phase rotations of both bullets to compare the other 5 pairs too."

The process initiates when the firing pin hits the bottom, and the breaking off at the bottom can happen any time between then and the bullet moving through the barrel of the gun and hitting its target. The light silver-grey line shows the region from which cross-cuts are extracted for automatic matching of the bullet lands."

In-phase here means that, for two bullets fired from the same barrel, each of the 6 LEAs from one bullet will only have one other LEA on the second bullet to which it is supposed to match. Therefore, only 6 pairs from the 36 pair-wise comparisons will have higher match scores than the rest. This is an immediate extension of the firing phenomenon of the gun, where a barrel has 6 Lands that engrave 6 LEAs on the bullet, therefore, for two bullets fired from the same gun, each bullet will only have 1 LEA that passes through a specific land of the barrel. Thus, there can only be 6 pairs of LEAs owing to the 6 lands of the barrel, and these 6 pairs are supposed to be represented on the diagonal of the given heatmap."

Uncertainty is embedded in the heatmap through the presence of multiple and similar such scores, due relative inference of the score of the comparison under consideration, with the scores of all other comparisons. There is also some ambiguity introduced due to the scales and color gradients"
